<p style="text-align:justify">The dominant general-purpose desktop operating 
system is Microsoft Windows with a market share of around 76.45%. macOS by Apple 
Inc. is in second place (17.72%), and the varieties of Linux are collectively in 
third place (1.73%).In the mobile sector (including smartphones and tablets), 
Android's share is up to 72% in the year 2020. According to third quarter 2016 
data, Android's share on smartphones is dominant with 87.5 percent with also a 
growth rate of 10.3 percent per year, followed by Apple's iOS with 12.1 percent 
with per year decrease in market share of 5.2 percent, while other operating 
systems amount to just 0.3 percent. Linux distributions are dominant in the 
server and supercomputing sectors. Other specialized classes of operating 
systems (special-purpose operating systems)), such as embedded and real-time 
systems, exist for many applications. Security-focused operating systems also 
exist. Some operating systems have low system requirements (e.g. light-weight

<p style="text-align:justify">The components of an operating system all exist in 
order to make the different parts of a computer work together. All user software 
needs to go through the operating system in order to use any of the hardware, 
whether it be as simple as a mouse or keyboard or as complex as an Internet

and

<span class="mw-headline"><span style="color:windowtext">Program execution<o:p></o:p></span></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">The operating system provides an interface between 
an application program and the computer hardware, so that an application program 
can interact with the hardware only by obeying rules and procedures programmed 
into the operating system. The operating system is also a set of services which 
simplify development and execution of application programs. Executing an 
application program involves the creation of a process by the operating system
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">kernel</span> which assigns memory space 
and other resources, establishes a priority for the process in multi-tasking 
systems, loads program binary code into memory, and initiates execution of the 
application program which then interacts with the user and with hardware 
devices. <o:p></o:p></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">
<span class="mw-headline"><span style="color:windowtext">Interrupts<o:p></o:p></span></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">Interrupts</span> are central to operating 
systems, as they provide an efficient way for the operating system to interact 
with and react to its environment. The alternative&nbsp;– having the operating system 
"watch" the various sources of input for events (polling) that require action&nbsp;– 
can be found in older systems with very small
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:
major-fareast">stacks</span> (50 or 60 bytes) but is unusual in modern systems 
with large stacks.
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">Interrupt</span>-based programming is 
directly supported by most modern CPUs. Interrupts provide a computer with a way 
of automatically saving local register contexts, and running specific code in 
response to events. Even very basic computers support hardware interrupts, and 
allow the programmer to specify code which may be run when that event takes 
place. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">When an interrupt is received, the computer's 
hardware automatically suspends whatever program is currently running, saves its 
status, and runs computer code previously associated with the interrupt; this is 
analogous to placing a bookmark in a book in response to a phone call. In modern 
operating systems, interrupts are handled by the operating system's
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
kernel</span>. Interrupts may come from either the computer's hardware or the 
running program.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">When a hardware device triggers an interrupt, the 
operating system's kernel decides how to deal with this event, generally by 
running some processing code. The amount of code being run depends on the 
priority of the interrupt (for example: a person usually responds to a smoke 
detector alarm before answering the phone). The processing of hardware 
interrupts is a task that is usually delegated to software called a
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
device driver</span>, which may be part of the operating system's kernel, part 
of another program, or both. Device drivers may then relay information to a 
running program by various means. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A program may also trigger an interrupt to the 
operating system. If a program wishes to access hardware, for example, it may 
interrupt the operating system's kernel, which causes control to be passed back 
to the kernel. The kernel then processes the request. If a program wishes 
additional resources (or wishes to shed resources) such as memory, it triggers 
an interrupt to get the kernel's attention. <o:p></o:p></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">
<span class="mw-headline"><span style="color:windowtext">Modes<o:p></o:p></span></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">Modern
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">microprocessors</span> (CPU or MPU) 
support multiple modes of operation. CPUs with this capability offer at least 
two modes:
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:
major-fareast">user mode</span> and
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">supervisor mode</span>. In general terms, 
supervisor mode operation allows unrestricted access to all machine resources, 
including all MPU instructions. User mode operation sets limits on instruction 
use and typically disallows direct access to machine resources. CPUs might have 
other modes similar to user mode as well, such as the virtual modes in order to 
emulate older processor types, such as 16-bit processors on a 32-bit one, or 
32-bit processors on a
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">64-bit</span> one. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">At power-on or reset, the system begins in 
supervisor mode. Once an operating system
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">kernel</span> 
has been loaded and started, the boundary between user mode and supervisor mode 
(also known as kernel mode) can be established. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Supervisor mode is used by the kernel for low 
level tasks that need unrestricted access to hardware, such as controlling how 
memory is accessed, and communicating with devices such as disk drives and video 
display devices. User mode, in contrast, is used for almost everything else. 
Application programs, such as word processors and database managers, operate 
within user mode, and can only access machine resources by turning control over 
to the kernel, a process which causes a switch to supervisor mode. Typically, 
the transfer of control to the kernel is achieved by executing a
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-theme-font:major-fareast">
software interrupt</span> instruction, such as the Motorola 68000 <code>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">TRAP</span></code> instruction. The software 
interrupt causes the microprocessor to switch from user mode to supervisor mode 
and begin executing code that allows the kernel to take control. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In user mode, programs usually have access to a 
restricted set of microprocessor instructions, and generally cannot execute any 
instructions that could potentially cause disruption to the system's operation. 
In supervisor mode, instruction execution restrictions are typically removed, 
allowing the kernel unrestricted access to all machine resources. <o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The term "user mode resource" generally refers to 
one or more CPU registers, which contain information that the running program 
isn't allowed to alter. Attempts to alter these resources generally causes a 
switch to supervisor mode, where the operating system can deal with the illegal 
operation the program was attempting, for example, by forcibly terminating 
("killing") the program). <o:p></o:p></p>
